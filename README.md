This is an investigation into how monad transformers behave when changing the order of composition.

So far, it has examples of all pairwise compositions of the Reader, Writer, State, Maybe, and Except monads (except for MaybeT Except / ExceptT Maybe). Please feel free to fork this repository and extend it to additional monads, especially Cont, List, or ST.
